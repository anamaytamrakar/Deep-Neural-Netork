# Deep-Neural-Network


## Objective 
The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on a deep neural network. 

## Problem Description
Recognizing multi-digit numbers in photographs captured at street level is an important component of modern-day map making. 
A classic example of a corpus of such streetlevel photographs is Google’s StreetView imagery comprised of hundreds of millions of
geo-located 360 degree panoramic images. 
The ability to automatically transcribe an address number from a geo-located patch of pixels and associate the transcribed number 
with a known street address helps pinpoint, with a high degree of accuracy, the location of the building it represents.
More broadly, recognizing numbers in photographs is a problem of interest to the optical character recognition community. 
While OCR on constrained domains like document processing is well studied, arbitrary multi-character text recognition in photographs is
still highly challenging. 
This difficulty arises due to the wide variability in the visual
appearance of text in the wild on account of a large range of fonts, colours, styles, orientations, and character arrangements. 
The recognition problem is further complicated by environmental factors such as lighting, shadows, secularities, and occlusions 
as well as by image acquisition factors such as resolution, motion, and focus blurs.
In this project I will use dataset with images centred around a single digit (many of the images contain some distractors at the sides).
Although I am taking a sample of the data which is simpler, it is more complex than MNIST because of the distractors.
## Data Description 
The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition 
algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem 
(recognizing digits and numbers innatural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
